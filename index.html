    <p><em>My name is <b>Virginia Adair</b>. I am a sophomore in college at The University of Georgia and I am from Tuscaloosa, Alabama. I chose to go to UGA because I always knew I didn't want to attend college in my hometown. I visited Athens and instantly loved it! However, I still do cheer for Alabama in football unless we are playing them! In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, eating at all of the fabulous restaurants Athens has to offer, and online shopping for the best deals.</em></p>
    <p><em>On this website I want to tell you a little about my favorite people in my life. I would not be where I am in life without the constant support and encouragement from my family! </em></p>
